# Landing Page Layout

## Button locked to image bottom

**The bottom of the "Enter Divergent" button must stay locked to the bottom of the hero image.** This is a fixed requirement for the landing view.

- Do not let extra or longer copy push the button down.
- The content column height is set in JS to match the image (from the image frame bottom, minus the column’s top padding). Keep that logic.
- Use `justify-content: space-between` and CTA `margin-top: auto` so the button stays at the bottom of the column.
- If text grows, keep the button fixed: use a scrollable or constrained text block (e.g. `min-height: 0` and `overflow-y: auto` on the text container) so the button position does not change.

When changing landing copy, layout, or styles, preserve this behavior unless the user explicitly asks to change it.
