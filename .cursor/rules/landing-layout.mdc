# Landing Page Layout

## Required behavior (do not regress)

For landing updates in `src/components/LandingPage.jsx` and `src/index.css`, preserve all of these:

1) **CTA anchor is deterministic**
- Bottom of `Enter Divergent` stays aligned to the hero image bottom on desktop/tablet.
- JS alignment keeps right column height tied to image frame bottom.

2) **Text body and CTA move as one bundle**
- Text body block is directly above CTA with a small fixed gap.
- Do not let the text body become an independent scrolling region that drifts away from CTA.
- The text body should respond to column width and right-side padding changes.

3) **Title collision behavior**
- Title position is independent from the body/CTA bundle.
- When body text rises, it must push title upward.
- Collision gap is fixed at **48px** minimum between title bottom and text-body top.

4) **Notice paragraph wrapping**
- Keep the notice paragraph width-responsive (no forced desktop no-wrap, no hard line-break locking).

Only change these rules if the user explicitly asks to alter the landing behavior.
