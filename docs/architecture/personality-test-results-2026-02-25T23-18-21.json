So either the money/title/prestige looks right but something feels off, or it looks questionable but you sense an opportunity nobody else is seeing.\n\n**What's the thing about this job that you can't quite articulate to the people giving you advice?** Because that's usually where the real decision lives—not in the salary negotiation or the benefits package, but in whatever dynamic you're picking up that doesn't fit the standard career-advice framework.\n\nTell me what the job actually is and what's making this complicated.
