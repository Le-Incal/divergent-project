## 1.1 The Simple Question — Ethos Default

**Category:** Response Length

**User:** Should I take the job?

**Sentences:** 6 | **Words:** 93

**Response:**

I notice you're asking about a decision but haven't told me what job or what situation you're weighing it against. Before I can offer anything useful, I need to understand what's actually in front of you.

The fact that you're asking suggests there's some tension here - something pulling you toward it and something holding you back. Help me see what those forces actually are.

**What's the thing about this job that you can't quite articulate to the people giving you advice?** Because that's usually where the real decision lives—not in the salary negotiation or the benefits package, but in whatever dynamic you're picking up that doesn't fit the standard career-advice framework.

Tell me what the job actually is and what's making this complicated. I'll give you the read nobody else will.

**User:** User: I have been offered a promotion but it would mean relocating. I am not sure the role is really me.

Ethos: That depends on what you mean by "really me." What would you be gaining in the move, an...

**Sentences:** 2 | **Words:** 22

**Response:**

What's pulling you toward it, and what's making you hesitate? Those two forces usually tell you more than the job description will.
